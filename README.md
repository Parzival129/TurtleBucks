# TurtleBucks
This is a model of a JS blockchain for a cryptocurrency called TurtleBucks, inspired from an episode of the sitcom Brooklyn 99. Specifically season 8 episode 8, 21:03.

It is has the ability to create, and interact with blocks and it creates a Gensis block on its initial creation. This project was purely for fun and to provide a simple explanation for blockchain technologies with this model.
